# Practical_Project_Computer_Vision_and_Image_Classification
My practical project when I studied Artificial Intelligence


Task:
- Take Covid data from this article: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7372265/ â€¦ or any other place you can find a credible source of covid lung imaging datasets.
- Train a model that can classify people as having covid and not having covid based on the images. 
- Almost no requirements on the performance of the model, anything >50% (random guessing) would be acceptable!
- No requirements for the usage of a framework: you can use Keras, Pytorch or Fast.ai - or even all.
- No requirements to use transfer learning (however it is recommended).
